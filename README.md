In Django, product data manipulation involves managing product records through CRUD operations using class-based views (CBVs) and models. Here's a breakdown:

1.Model: Define the product schema in models.py.
2.Views: Use class-based views for CRUD:
      CreateView – Add new products.
      ListView – Display all products.
      UpdateView – Edit existing products.
      DeleteView – Remove products.
3.Templates: Create HTML templates for user interaction.
4.URLs: Map the views to specific routes for navigation.
